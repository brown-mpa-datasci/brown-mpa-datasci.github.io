<h1><a class="header" href="#welcome" id="welcome">Welcome!!!</a></h1>
<p>The aim of this module is to be a fully asynchronous introduction to programming and data science for students in Brown's MPA program. Most of the content for this module was pulled from different iteration of the MPA 2065 course<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. The module is divided in to 4 sub-modules, with each lesson being mostly independent of one another<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This module is a highly applied introduction to data science and programming for students who do not yet have experience in these areas. The overall objective for this module is to empower students to use a technical computing language to acquire, clean, and analyze data in order to answer policy-based research questions.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>This module does not assume any previous exposure to programming. We do assume some exposure to probability and statistics. In particular, we presume students have completed one semester of introductory statistics. </p>
<hr />
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> So, if you have already take this course, then the material (and the video lessons) will mostly be review.</p>
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> The exception here is for the <code>Foundations</code> lesson. As the name implies, this is an essential lesson for understanding other sub-modules.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#module-format" id="module-format">Module Format</a></h1>
<p>The module attempts to be a &quot;from-the-ground-up&quot; approach to reading and writing code in a technical computing language. As mentioned previously, we do not make any assumptions about students' prior exposure to any programming language. The examples will primarily be done using the R programming language<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This website contains the notes for the various topics, as well as the videos lessons for the related topics. The videos appear as links at the end of a given section; the videos lessons are also all linked in the Appendix. </p>
<hr />
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> For those with existing programming language preferences, we will happily answer question if you choose to complete the exercises in R, Python, or Julia. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#module-resources" id="module-resources">Module Resources</a></h1>
<p>The module utilize a combination of tools for asynchronous learning. In particular, we will use this website as the platform for sharing notes and video lessons. We will also use the JupyterHub<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> computing environment for completing exercises and following along with the code. </p>
<p>Additionally, all lessons' slides and code for this module are available on GitHub<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#jupyter" id="jupyter">Jupyter</a></h1>
<h1><a class="header" href="#unix-shell" id="unix-shell">Unix Shell</a></h1>
<p>A huge proportion of scientific computing, software engineering, and data science is done using decendants of the Unix operating system. Both Linux and macOS are in the Unix family tree, and as such, they offer a &quot;shell&quot; for talking to the operating system. A shell is essentially a program to launch other programs. </p>
<p>In practice, the shell is frequently used for issuing commands that manipulate files and folders on the computer, but the shell is a phoenomenally powerful mechanism for performing a huge number of tasks. It is generally accepted that a person who is considered a technologist of any kind will be comfortable working from the operating system (OS) shell.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#shell-basics" id="shell-basics">Shell Basics</a></h2>
<p>On Linux and macOS, you can access the shell by opening the <code>Terminal</code> application. Once you've opened the terminal, you will see a default command prompt that looks somewhat like the one below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">work_macbook@:~ paul$
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>work_macbook</code> would actually be the name of your machine, and <code>paul</code> would be your username. Your prompt will obviously look a bit different. The key feature is that the prompt will typically end with the <code>$</code> character. This is where you issue commands to the operating system.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exploring-filesystem" id="exploring-filesystem">Exploring Filesystem</a></h2>
<p>The filesystem you see when you interact with the prompt is the same as you would see using an application like <code>Finder</code> (on macOS). That is, you can see the files and folders as you normally would using the graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
<p>One of the most common commands used for exploring the file system is <code>ls</code>. This issues a command to the operating system to &quot;list&quot; the files in the currect directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ls
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Applications         Dropbox (Brown)   Public      software

</code></pre>
<p>The output of <code>ls</code> shows a list of the files and directories (i.e., folders) in our current location. Note that by default, our &quot;current location&quot; is probably the &quot;home&quot; directory of our user. We can determine our current directory with the <code>pwd</code> command, which is short for <strong>p</strong>rint <strong>w</strong>orking <strong>d</strong>irectory). See the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pwd
</code></pre>
<pre><code>/Users/paul
</code></pre>
<p>And in the example above <code>paul</code> would be replaced by your username. </p>
<p>Note that we can use <code>ls</code> to show more information or to display the information in slightly different way. This is done by passing optional arguments when calling <code>ls</code>. For example, it is very common to run <code>ls -l</code>, which produces output like you see below.</p>

<p>Adding the optional <code>-l</code> &quot;flag&quot; when calling the <code>ls</code> command gives us output that is much more verbose than our original <code>ls</code> command. We will explore in greater detail what each of these columns mean, but short explanation is that this gives us information about who owns the files or directories, what the permission settings are, the sizes, and when they were last changed. </p>
<p>Another very useful flag we can pass when calling <code>ls</code> is the <code>-a</code> option. This tells the operating system we would like to see a list of <em>all</em> files and directories in the current working directory—this includes those that are &quot;hidden&quot;. It is worth noting here that on Unix-like systems, hidden files and directories have the <code>.</code> symbol as the first character in their names. Thus, saving a file as <code>.find_me.txt</code> on a Unix-like system would cause it to be a hidden file. </p>
<p>We can also chain together flags when we call <code>ls</code>—or any other command. For example, running <code>ls -la</code> is very common, and it tells the operating system to list all the files, including the hidden ones, and to do so in the more verbose &quot;long&quot; format. </p>
<p>We can move around the filesystem using the <code>cd</code> command. This command lets us <strong>c</strong>hange the <strong>d</strong>irectory in which we are currently. For example if we are in our home directory (e.g., <code>/Users/paul</code>) and we want to change to the <code>Documents</code> directory, we would issue the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd Documents
</code></pre>
<p>And now if we issue the <code>pwd</code> command, we will see our new current working directory has changed to something similar to the example below.</p>
<pre><code>/Users/paul/Documents
</code></pre>
<p>We can return to our previous directory by typing the <code>cd ..</code>, which is the Unix shorthand for &quot;<em>go back up one level in the file hierarchy</em>&quot;. This leaves us back in the <code>/Users/paul</code> directory. Note that if we wanted to back up two levels, we would run <code>cd ../..</code>, which would leave us in the <code>/Users</code> directory. And of course, we could take that even further by running <code>cd ../../..</code> which would take us up three levels in the hierarchy in to the <code>/</code> directory, which is the top-level directory.</p>
<p>Another very useful shorthand is using the <code>cd</code> command by itself. The default behavior when simply running <code>cd</code> is for the operating system to return you to your &quot;home&quot; directory. The &quot;home&quot; directory is the base location in the filesystem where a user will have files and directories belonging to them; in my case <code>/Users/paul</code> is my home directory. The files and directories within are &quot;mine&quot;. It is also common to return to the home directory by running <code>cd ~</code> or sometimes <code>cd ~/</code>. All of these have the same effect of returning the user to their home directory.</p>
<p>Note that as we previously used the <code>cd</code> command to enter the <code>Documents</code> directory, we can also use <code>cd</code> to enter the sub-directories within <code>Documents</code> directory—that is, those directories that are themselves in the <code>Documents</code> directory. This is done using the same <code>/</code> notation that we used when moving up two levels in the filesystem hierarchy. That is, instead of running <code>cd ../..</code>, we would run <code>cd Documents/Courses</code>. Here <code>Courses</code> is the sub-directory within Documents.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-undeniable-beauty-of-tab-complete" id="the-undeniable-beauty-of-tab-complete">The Undeniable Beauty of <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>-Complete</a></h3>
<p>One of the wildly useful and lovely features of Unix-like shells is the ability to use the <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key to complete a command. For example, suppose we have directory named <code>my_very_important_cool_project</code>. And suppose further that we want to <code>cd</code> in to that directory. To accomplish this, we would obviously need to type <code>cd my_very_important_cool_project</code>. But suppose also that we are lazy and would prefer not to type out a 30-character directory name. This is the beauty of <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>-complete. We can simply start typing our command (e.g., <code>cd my_very</code>) and then press <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>, and the operating system will fill in the rest of the directory name. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#absolute-and-relative-paths" id="absolute-and-relative-paths">Absolute and Relative Paths</a></h3>
<p>It is worth noting at this point that the <code>cd</code> commands we have been running have thus far all been using the &quot;relative&quot; paths of directories. That is, the commands worked because or our position in the filesystem <em>relative</em> to the directory we wanted to access. For example, if we were back in the <code>/Users</code> directory, running <code>cd Documents</code> would return the error below. </p>
<pre><code>bash: cd: Documents: No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>What this error tells us is that <code>cd</code> returned an error because it could not find that file or directory. And this is because the <code>Documents</code> directory is in the home directory of the user <code>paul</code>. So if we want <code>cd Documents</code> to work as we expect, we need to run that from within the <code>/Users/paul</code> directory. </p>
<p>However, we could also acheive the desired result by passing the <code>cd</code> command the <em>absolute path</em> of the directory. That is, we could run <code>cd /Users/paul/Documents</code>, and this would work exactly as intended. And furthermore, this would work as intended <em>regardless of where we are in the filesystem</em>. We could be anywhere, and if we run <code>cd /Users/paul/Documents</code>, it would always take us to the <code>Documents</code> directory in our home directory.</p>
<p>Note that the above applies for more than just the <code>cd</code> command; the concept of relative and absolute paths is also true for <code>ls</code> and any other command. For example we could be anywhere on the filesystem, and if we run <code>ls /Users/paul/Documents</code>, it will show a list of the files and directories in our <code>Documents</code> directory.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#moving-and-renaming-files" id="moving-and-renaming-files">Moving and Renaming Files</a></h2>
<p>We can use the <code>mv</code> command both for moving and for renaming files and directories. Lets start by creating a file named <code>potato.txt</code>. We can use the <code>touch</code> command to create this file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">touch potato.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We can then use <code>mv</code> to rename the file to be <code>fries.txt</code> using the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mv potato.txt fries.txt
</code></pre>
<p>And now we can also use <code>mv</code> to move the file to a completely different location.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mv fries.txt /tmp
</code></pre>
<p>The command above takes the <code>fries.txt</code> file and moves it to the <code>/tmp</code> directory.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#creating-directories" id="creating-directories">Creating Directories</a></h2>
<p>We have already seen that <code>ls</code> can be used to list the contents of the current working directory. And we have seen that <code>pwd</code> will print the full path of our current working directory. Now we examine the command <code>mkdir</code>. As you might have guessed from the name, this command is used to <strong>m</strong>ake <strong>d</strong>irectories. For example, suppose we return to our <code>Documents</code> directory using the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/Documents
</code></pre>
<p>We can then create the directory <code>/Users/paul/Documents/mpa2065</code> by running the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir mpa2065
</code></pre>
<p>We can now treat this directory like any other (i.e., create files or directories inside it). </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#copying-files-and-directories" id="copying-files-and-directories">Copying Files (and Directories)</a></h2>
<p>We can use the <code>cp</code> command to create copies of files and directories. When creating a copy of a file, we simply pass two arguments to <code>cp</code>: the name of the &quot;source&quot; file, and the path or name of the copy being made. For example, let's create a file called <code>foo.txt</code> in our <code>Documents</code> directory. We can do this with the commands below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/Documents

touch foo.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose now that we want to create a copy of <code>foo.txt</code> and call it <code>foo2.txt</code>. We can do this by running the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cp foo.txt foo2.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The first argument to <code>cp</code> is our source file, and the second is what we want to call the output. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#removing-files-and-directories" id="removing-files-and-directories">Removing Files and Directories</a></h2>
<p>The <code>rm</code> command is used to remove (i.e., permanently delete) files and directories. The exact syntax for deleting a file is simply <code>rm &lt;filename&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> is the name of the file. So for example, the command below would delete the <code>foo.txt</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rm foo.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>rm</code> for deleting directories. This is done by passing the <code>-r</code> flag when calling <code>rm</code>. For example, the commands below creates and then subsequently deletes the directory <code>baz</code>. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir baz

rm -r baz
</code></pre>
<h1><a class="header" href="#git-basics" id="git-basics">Git Basics</a></h1>
<p>The most popular version control system for code is Git. In this section we will discuss the basic features of a version control system as well as why version control systems are important. We will also go through the basics of Git, in particular, as well as its relative advantages over other version control systems that came before. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-version-control" id="why-version-control">Why Version Control?</a></h2>
<p>Version control systems exist to solve a number of related problems. First, we would like snapshots of our code that allow us to implement new features and components that map to a particular version tag (e.g., &quot;<em>Encrypted sharding is available as of version 1.2.0</em>&quot;). Second, we would like to confidentally make changes to our code while also preserving the ability to &quot;roll back&quot; the code to a known-good state. Being able to experiment with so-called breaking changes before pushing them in to a more production-level release is an essential component of writing code. Third, we would like to be able to code collaboratively such that one person can be working on feature <code>abc</code> and another person working on feature <code>xyz</code> in the same code base. This last problem (i.e., having <em>distributed</em> version control) is solved particular well by Git. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#distributed-version-control" id="distributed-version-control">Distributed Version Control</a></h3>
<p>The predecessors of Git were less effective in solving the problem of distributed version control. And since modern code bases are often in the hundreds-of-thousands (or even millions) of lines of code, it would be impossible for a single developer to do all the maintence. Thus, we need large teams to work collaboratively, while also preserving the ability to make changes without &quot;clobbering&quot; each others' work.</p>
<p>You may not have considered this yet, but if you have ever used Google Docs, or any similar product, then you have already used a distributed version control system. Google Docs can be shared and simultaneously editted by an arbitrarilly large number of authors. Moreover, Google also provides some functionality for reversing changes and re-instantiating prior versions of the document. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-git-repository" id="what-is-a-git-repository">What is a Git Repository?</a></h2>
<p>At a high-level, a Git repository—often called a &quot;repo&quot;—is a directory which we have flagged to be version controlled by Git. Essentially, we have told Git &quot;<em>Please track changes to files in this directory</em>&quot;. </p>
<p>A very typical Git workflow is to have a repository per project or per software application. Files are then &quot;checked in&quot; to version control when we tell Git that we want the files tracked. We then take snapshots—known as &quot;commits&quot; in Git parlance—when we make significant or important changes. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#local-vs-remote-repositories" id="local-vs-remote-repositories">Local vs. Remote Repositories</a></h3>
<p>A key distinction should be made before we move on. That distinction is between the &quot;local&quot; and &quot;remote&quot; repository. As the name implies, a local repository exists on you &quot;local machine&quot; (e.g., your laptop or desktop). A remote repository, on the other hand, exists in some location other than your local machine; thus, it is remote in the sense that it is elsewhere. Remote repositories are typically housed on purpose-built platforms for code sharing and version control. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#github-and-remote-repos" id="github-and-remote-repos">Github and Remote Repos</a></h3>
<p>Github is one of the most popular code sharing and versioning platforms; other similar platforms currently include Gitlab and Bitbucket. All three of these platforms share a great deal of the same functionality. In particular, they give us a place to store, distribute, and backup our code. These platforms are typically what we use to house our &quot;remote repos&quot; mentioned above. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#basic-git-workflow" id="basic-git-workflow">Basic Git Workflow</a></h2>
<p>In this section we walk through a standard Git workflow of creating a repository, then committing code to the repository, making some changes, and then committing the changes. We must first ensure that Git is actually installed on our machine; to confirm this, we can simply open the shell and run <code>git --version</code>. This should return some output like we see below.</p>
<pre><code>git version 2.20.1
</code></pre>
<p>If we instead observe an error message suggesting <code>command not found</code>, then we must install Git through the standard methods (e.g., <code>brew install git</code> on macOS, <code>apt-get install git</code> on Debian and Ubuntu, <code>yum install git</code> on CentOS and Red Hat, etc.).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#creating-a-git-repo" id="creating-a-git-repo">Creating a Git Repo</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, a Git repository is a directory that we have asked Git to monitor. Thus, if we are starting a new project, we would often begin by creating the diretory itself. Recall that on Unix-like systems we can create directories using the <code>mkdir</code> command. </p>
<p>Suppose we like the first sentences of novels, and suppose that we are creating a repository to store all our favorite first lines. Let us create a directory called <code>first_lines</code>. We do this by issuing the command below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir ~/first_lines
</code></pre>
<p>Note that by specifying <code>~/first_lines</code>, we will be creating the directory in our &quot;home&quot; directory, (i.e., in my case, <code>/Users/paul</code>). So I should now have a directory at <code>/Users/paul/first_lines</code>. To confirm this, we can run the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ls ~/
</code></pre>
<p>And we should see the <code>first_lines</code> directory in the output of that command.</p>
<p>Now, in order to actually initialize this directory as a git repo, we will first <code>cd</code> in to the directory with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/first_lines
</code></pre>
<p>And once we are inside the <code>first_lines</code> directory, we can then initialize the directory as a git repository with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git init
</code></pre>
<p>This has the effect of telling <code>git</code> that we want the changes to the contents of this directory to be tracked. Just to confirm, we can then run this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git status
</code></pre>
<p>and we should see some output like this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>
<p>As this output suggests, we are on the <code>main</code> branch in this repository, and we have not yet made any commits.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#making-our-first-commit" id="making-our-first-commit">Making our First Commit</a></h3>
<p>Let's open a plaintext editor (e.g., Nano, Vim, Emacs, Sublime) and create a file called <code>lines.txt</code> and populate with our first entry, which is the first line of <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</p>
<pre><code>There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.
</code></pre>
<p>Let's save and exit from our text editor. And now we will again run <code>git status</code>. This time we get some more interesting output.</p>
<pre><code>On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)

	lines.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>
<p>As we see above, git has now noticed that we have a file that exists in this repo, but it is not yet tracked. And Git even gives us the hint that our next step to add the file to be track is to use the <code>git add</code> command, which we do with the command below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git add lines.txt
</code></pre>
<p>And now when we run <code>git status</code> again, we see something like the output below.</p>
<pre><code>On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

	new file:   lines.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Git has noticed that we have added a file to the staging area, but no commits have been made yet. We can finally make the commit with the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git commit -m &quot;added line from jane eyre&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>git commit</code> command tells Git to add the file(s) from the staging area to the repository, and we pass it a commit message using the <code>-m</code> optional flag followed by the message in quotes. Git will then provide some output like we see below to confirm that the commit has been successful.</p>
<pre><code>[main (root-commit) aa601ee] added line from jane eyre
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 lines.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We can also get more information about the commit by using the <code>git log</code> command, which generates output much like what we see below.</p>
<pre><code>commit aa601eed8c173947c345fa1d213a919bdf2c11cd (HEAD -&gt; main)
Author: paul &lt;paul@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Wed Sep 10 18:43:51 2019 -0400

    added line from jane eyre
</code></pre>
<p>A couple of points ought to be noted here. First, git commits all have unique identifiers that are a 40-character string of alphanumberics. This is how we can uniquely identify a commit. Also note that the commit log stores all the information regarding the commit's author and timestamp. And of course, the commit log has the commit message associated with the commit.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-commit" id="adding-a-new-commit">Adding a New Commit</a></h3>
<p>Suppse we want to add another line to our <code>lines.txt</code> file. In this case, let's add the first line of <em>Anna Karenina</em> using our text editor.</p>
<pre><code>Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's save those changes and close our text editor. And if we run <code>git status</code> again, we see something like the output below. </p>
<pre><code>On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   lines.txt

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, Git has noticed that we have made changes to the <code>lines.txt</code> file. In order to capture these changes in the repo, we need to use <code>git add lines.txt</code> once again. After that, we can move those changes from the staging area to the actual repository with the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git commit -m &quot;added anna karenina&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now in case we are curious we can explore the differences between Git commits using the <code>git diff</code> command. In particular, we use <code>git diff</code> in combination with the commit ID (or the first few characters of it), and the file name. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git diff aa601 lines.txt
</code></pre>
<p>As we see in the command above, we tell Git to show us the differences between in the <code>lines.txt</code> file in the current state and that of the commit whose commit ID starts with <code>aa601</code>.</p>
<p>And we would then see some output like this:</p>
<pre><code>diff --git a/lines.txt b/lines.txt

<h2><a class="header" href="#remote-repositories" id="remote-repositories">Remote Repositories</a></h2>
<p>The concept of a &quot;remote repository&quot; highlights one of Git's greatest strength. As mentioned above, a local repository refers to the Git repository on your &quot;local&quot; machine (but note that &quot;local machine&quot; might actually be the server you are using). The &quot;remote repository&quot; is a repository that lives elsewhere—typically on a hosting platform such as Github or one of their counterparts (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). </p>
<p>Remote repos enable the distributed aspect of version control with Git. For example, we might have two software engineers, Jones and Lee, each working on the same code base. Lee might be adding feature <code>xyz</code> and Jones might be adding feature <code>abc</code>. They can both implement the features on their local machines, and in many cases, neither needs to be involved in the other's development. Then, once they are finished, they can push their respective changes to the remote repository where they can be integrated. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#adding-a-remote-repository" id="adding-a-remote-repository">Adding a Remote Repository</a></h3>
<p>For repositories that we have started &quot;from scratch&quot; on our local machines, we can add a remote repo whenever we would like. This has a couple of steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create remote repo</li>
<li>Grab URL of the remote repo</li>
<li>Add remote to local git</li>
</ol>
<p>The above steps are carried out differently depending on the hosting platform you choose, but they should be fairly transparent once you have done it once or twice. On GitHub, we simply click on the <code>+</code> icon in the top-right corner, and then select <code>New repository</code>. </p>
<p>Once we have created the remote in GitHub (or on another hosting platform), we can simply return to our local repo and run this</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git remote add orgin &lt;URL&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;URL&gt;</code> is replaced by the URL for the newly created remote repo. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repo" id="pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repo">Pushing Commits to a Remote Repo</a></h3>
<p>Once we have added our remote repo, and we have made some commits, we are ready to push these to the remote repo. This is simply done using <code>git push</code> command followed by the name of the remote, which we specified above as <code>origin</code> as well as the name of the branch. In the example below, we are pushing to the <code>main</code> branch. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git push origin main
</code></pre>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-r-programming-language" id="the-r-programming-language">The R Programming Language</a></h1>
<p>The R programming language has a rather interesting history. The language itself was developed in the mid 90s by two statisiticians—Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentlemen. But interestingly, the language that Ihaka and Gentlemen developed is actually an implementation of the S programming language, which was developed at Bell Labs primarily by John Chambers in the mid 70s. It is important to note that there was a commercial version of the S language sold under the name <em>S Plus</em> in the 80s. However, R, the language that Ihaka and Gentlemen developed was free and open-source.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-r" id="why-r">Why R?</a></h2>
<p>The original S language was developed specifically for its application to statistical problems. At the time, a great deal of statisitical problems were being solved using the &quot;lower-level&quot;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> language called <em>Fortran</em>. While the Fortran programming language was (and still is) known of it's speed of execution, the syntax and semantics of the language make it not-so-friendly for reading, writing, and debugging.</p>
<p>Both the S programming language—and later R—were designed to give the user access to a &quot;high-level&quot; language that could be used for quickly developing code to solve problems and answer statistical questions. In sum, R is a language that is meant to make it easy to work with data.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> The term &quot;lower-level&quot; when referring to a programming language is not in any way derogatory. Instead, it referrs to languages which provide a high degree of access and control over the machine's resources (e.g., processor, memory, storage, networking). Low-level languages are said to be &quot;close to the metal&quot;.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#variables-and-types" id="variables-and-types">Variables and Types</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#basic-math-with-r" id="basic-math-with-r">Basic Math with R</a></h2>
<p>We can begin our exploration of R by using it in the most straightforward manner; that is, we will use R as a &quot;fancy calculator&quot;. We will quickly see that R is capable of vastly more than a calculator, but this is a good place for us to begin our journey.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">13 + 7
</code></pre>
<p>We see from above that R can nicely perform simple addition. And the example below also demonstates slightly more interesting arithmetic.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">13 + 7 * 100
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see above, R will respect the rules that govern order of operation in arithemetic. If we wanted to be more explicit, we could also add parantheses to the above expression. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">13 + (7 * 100)
</code></pre>
<p>And of course, we can also use the parantheses to control the order of operations and change the above result.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">(13 + 7) * 100
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#variable-assignment" id="variable-assignment">Variable Assignment</a></h2>
<p>In a more realistic scenario, we would perform some computation and also want to preserve the result in some way such that it is accessible for subsequent computations. Essentially, we want to tell the machine &quot;<em>Do this math, and store the result</em>&quot;. This is something we can acheive using the assignment operator in R. The assignment operator in R is the arrow <code>&lt;-</code>, which we construct using the less-than symbol combined with the dash symbol.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<pre><code class="language-r">a &lt;- 13 + 7
</code></pre>
<p>Programming is essentially just about giving a computer instructions. The above code is us telling the computer to take <code>13</code> and <code>7</code>, add them together, and then put the result in <code>a</code>. Here <code>a</code> is just a completely arbitrary label for the result of <code>13 + 7</code>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>Note that the above code snippet does not immediately generate output. However, this is the default behavior when performing assignment. But now if we wanted to print the result of the computation, we can simply use the <code>print()</code> function in R.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">print(a)         # show us the value of `a`
</code></pre>
<p>Two things are worth noting from the code snippet above. First, we have seen our first example of the <code>print()</code> function. This is a function in R that is used to display the contents of objects. Here, we pass <code>a</code> to the print function, and we then observe the value of <code>a</code>, which is <code>20</code> as expected. </p>
<p>The second thing to note is that we have now seen our first comment. Using the <code>#</code> character is how we tell R that we are just leaving a note for our future selves or others who end up reading our code. Everything on the line that is to the right of <code>#</code> will not be evaluated by R.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#basic-types" id="basic-types">Basic Types</a></h2>
<p>There are a few things that contribute to how a programming languages &quot;feels&quot;. Without question, one of the key elements is the language's type system. A language's type system essentially refers to the kinds of values the langauge can represent (e.g., integers, boolean values, strings of characters, <em>etc</em>.).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#numeric-types" id="numeric-types">Numeric Types</a></h3>
<p>We have already seen examples of a numeric type. In the examples above, computing the sum of <code>13</code> and <code>7</code> gives us an integer value. We can inspect the type of an element with the <code>typeof()</code> function. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">b &lt;- 17 + 13         

typeof(b)   
</code></pre>
<p>We see the above result is <code>&quot;double&quot;</code>, which stands for &quot;<em>double precision floating point number</em>&quot;. This is how R stores the result of many numeric operations. Consider the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">d &lt;- 1.3 + 7.1

typeof(d)
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#boolean-types" id="boolean-types">Boolean Types</a></h3>
<p>Like most other languages, R is also capable of representing Boolean values (i.e., <code>logical</code> values <code>TRUE</code>, and <code>FALSE</code>). As we will see later, these kinds of values end up being very useful when working with conditional expressions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">bool_val &lt;- FALSE

typeof(bool_val)
</code></pre>
<p>Like many other langauges, R also lets us do arithmetic with boolean values. Consider the example below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">num_trues &lt;- TRUE + FALSE + TRUE 

print(num_trues)
</code></pre>
<p>This is something that we will see later has the ability to help us count occurences.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#character-strings" id="character-strings">Character Strings</a></h3>
<p>Another hugely important type of variable is the character string. These are simply the type <code>character</code> in R. The character string is simply a sequence of letters. Consider the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">dog_name &lt;- &quot;willie&quot;

typeof(dog_name)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we have created a character string called <code>dog_name</code>, and we assign it the value of <code>&quot;willie&quot;</code>. And upon checking, we also see that this variable has the type <code>character</code>. </p>
<p>We can perform many intesting operations on character strings. Suppose we wanted to paste together two character strings; we can do so using the <code>paste()</code> function in R. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">pets &lt;- paste(&quot;willie&quot;, &quot;and leo&quot;)   # paste together

print(pets)
</code></pre>
<p>We can also take variables saved as strings and paste them together. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_opinion &lt;- paste(pets, &quot;are great!&quot;)

print(my_opinion)
</code></pre>
<p>Here we see that we can take the saved string variable <code>pets</code> and paste it together with <code>&quot;are great!&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>We can also change between upper and lowercase characters by using the <code>toupper()</code> and the <code>tolower()</code> functions, respectively. Consider the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_loud_opinion &lt;- toupper(my_opinion)

print(my_loud_opinion)
</code></pre>
<p>Much as we use the <code>paste()</code> function to combine character strings, we can use the <code>substr()</code> function to take subsets of a given string. For example the snippet below returns the first 3 elements of the string <code>my_opinion</code> and stores them in a new variable called <code>name_fragment</code>, which we then print.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">name_fragment &lt;- substr(my_opinion, 1, 3)

print(name_fragment)
</code></pre>
<p>There are a host of other functions for working with strings in R. And we will later explore many that live in the <code>stringr</code> add-on package in R.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#container-types" id="container-types">Container Types</a></h2>
<p>As the name implies, container types in R tend to be types that &quot;hold things&quot;. There are many different container types in R, and we will explore the most common and useful here. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-vector-type" id="the-vector-type">The <code>vector</code> Type</a></h3>
<p>One hugely usefull example of a container type is the <code>vector</code> type. This is effectively just an ordered sequence of entries. We can construct <code>vector</code> types in a number of ways, but the most basic is using the <code>c()</code> funciton. The <code>c()</code> function basically concatenates the elements that we pass it in to a single container. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_vect &lt;- c(55, 32, 123)

print(my_vect)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>vector</code> type turns out to be one of the most fundamental in the R language. We will see vectors appear very often. Vectors can contain any type of objects, but a given vector in R will only contain a single type.</p>
<p>Accessing elements of a vector can be done using the square bracket notation seen below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">foo &lt;- c(11, 22, 33)

foo[1]                # get first element
</code></pre>
<p>Like the Julia programming language, R uses 1-based indexing, which means that a vector's first element is accessed using a <code>1</code> combined with the square bracket notation. We can also obtain &quot;slices&quot; of a vector by using the <code>:</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">bar &lt;- c(&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;)

animals &lt;- bar[1:2]   # get first two elements
</code></pre>
<p>The code snippet above uses the square-bracket notation for indexing combined with the <code>:</code> operator for defining a range of the vector we want to obtain.</p>
<p>We can also index a vector using <em>another vector</em>. That is we can index the contents of the vector <code>bar</code> by using the square-bracket notation and a second vector of indices. This is illustrated below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">people &lt;- c(&quot;ned&quot;, &quot;jon&quot;, &quot;robb&quot;, &quot;arya&quot;)

is_stark &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)

starks &lt;- people[is_stark]
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-matrix-type" id="the-matrix-type">The <code>matrix</code> Type</a></h3>
<p>Much the the <code>vector</code> data type, the <code>matrix</code> type is designed for holding elements that are themselves all of the same type (e.g., all numeric, or all strings, etc.).</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">dat &lt;- seq(1, 12)          

m &lt;- matrix(dat, nrow = 3)

print(m)
</code></pre>
<p>Slicing and indexing an array works in much the same way as with vectors; that is, we used the familiar square-bracket notation. In the example below, we access the element in the second row, third column.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">m[2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in the above example the <code>2</code> inside the square bracket corresponds to the row, and the <code>3</code> corresponds to the column. </p>
<p>The matrix objects also lets us access entire rows or columns by leaving one of the indexes blank. For example, in the code snippet below, we are accessing the entire third column.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">m[, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we have left a blank space where the row index would typically be placed. This is the equivalent of saying &quot;<em>All of these!</em>&quot;. We can also do the same for columns; in the example below, we are essentially saying, &quot;<em>Give me the entire second row.</em>&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">m[2, ]
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-array-type" id="the-array-type">The <code>array</code> Type</a></h2>
<p>Both the <code>vector</code> type and the <code>matrix</code> type can actually be thought of as simply a special case of the <code>array</code> type. An <code>array</code> is the R type for reprsenting <em>N</em>-dimensional arrays; these are containers that have elements that are all of the same type. The number of dimensions defines how we do indexing. If we have a one-dimensional <code>array</code>, we simply have a vector, so we could access the third element (for example) by using <code>v[3]</code>. If we have a two-dimensional array, this is essentially a matrix, and we can access the second row, third column (for exmample) by using <code>m[2, 3]</code>. Now suppose we want to work with a three-dimensional array. The example below creates a three-dimensional array and then illustrates how we index in to it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">dat &lt;- seq(1, 24)

arr &lt;- array(dat, c(4, 2, 3))

print(arr)

arr[2, 1, 3]     # second row, first column, third layer
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we create a three-dimensional array called <code>arr</code>, and then we use the familiar bracket notation to get the element in the second row and first column of the third &quot;layer&quot;. </p>
<p>When taking slices of <code>array</code> objects, we can also leave indices blank to indicate &quot;<em>All of these!</em>&quot; as we did with the <code>matrix</code> object. For example, in the snippet below we get the entire third layer of the <code>arr</code> array. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">arr[, , 3]
</code></pre>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Strictly speaking, there are a few assignment operators in R, including the equal sign, which is much more common in other programming languages. However, when learning a programming language, it is generally preferred to adopt the conventions of the language. And the convention in R has always been to use <code>&lt;-</code> for assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>It is worth noting that variable names are almost completely arbitrary; we could just as easily have said <code>potato &lt;- 13 + 7</code>, and the only difference is that when we want to retrieve the value, we would now use <code>potato</code> to refer to it rather than <code>a</code>. The only restriction on variable names in R is that they must begin with an upper or lowercase letter.</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#functions" id="functions">Functions</a></h1>
<p>One of the most fundemental methods of organizing code—in any language—is with the use of functions. A function is basically a stand-alone block of code that we can use to carry out operations. In many cases, functions in programming languages work like functions in math; that is, they take some inputs, perform some operations, and then produce some output.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for defining functions; one of the more obvious reasons for defining a function is that it allows us to compartmentalize our code in a rational way. For example if we have some lengthy set of operations we want to perform on some given input, we might want to write a function that carries out that set of operations. This way, instead of repeatedly carrying out the operations in an explicit manner, we simply call the function repeatedly.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#defining-a-simple-function" id="defining-a-simple-function">Defining a Simple Function</a></h2>
<p>Functions in R are simply another kind of object. And as such, we create functions using the assignment operator (i.e., <code>&lt;-</code>) that we have already encountered. For example, the code snippet below creates a function cleverly called <code>add_one()</code> that adds <code>1</code> to whatever we pass it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">add_one &lt;- function(x) {
    x_plus1 &lt;- x + 1          # add 1 to x 
    return(x_plus1)           # return result of x + 1
}

</code></pre>
<p>The code snippet above defines a function that has a parameter, <code>x</code>, and then returns a new variable that is the result of adding <code>x</code> and <code>1</code> together. </p>
<p>Another noteworthy point from the above snippet is our use of indentation. When defining functions, or using other constructs in R that contain a &quot;code block&quot;, it is considered best practice to use indentation to denote the code block. The convention in R is to use 4 spaces, or a tab that indents the equivalent of 4 spaces. Note that this is only a stylistics convention.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">1</a></sup> </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#using-a-function" id="using-a-function">Using a Function</a></h3>
<p>The above snippet has defined this function. Now when we actually want to use the function, we do so as we would any other function (e.g., the <code>print()</code> function, which we have used widely already).</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">add_one(42)
</code></pre>
<p>As expected, our function takes single argument, <code>42</code>, and then returns the result of <code>42</code> plus <code>1</code>. Note that, like other functions, if we wanted to store the result of our function, we would simply assign that to a new variable. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">a &lt;- add_one(137)

print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>The snippet above illustrates how we would use our function assign its results to a new variable, <code>a</code>. And again, this is the same behavior as we would see with any of the built-in R functions.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that our function can also take other variables as arguments. That is, we need not pass it an integer literal. Consider the example below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">z &lt;- 13 
y &lt;- add_one(z) 

print(y)
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#functions-with-multiple-arguments" id="functions-with-multiple-arguments">Functions with Multiple Arguments</a></h2>
<p>We can also define functions that accept multiple arguments. The code snippet below illustrates how this is done.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">adding_something &lt;- function(a, b) {
    res &lt;- a + b 
    return(res)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can then use the <code>adding_something()</code> function much like we did with <code>add_one()</code>. And as we did before, if we wanted to use the output of the function, we can simply assign it to a new variable. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">u &lt;- adding_something(21, 29)

print(u)
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#default-function-arguments" id="default-function-arguments">Default Function Arguments</a></h3>
<p>Often we want functions to perform a given operation with some default arguments. Suppose, for example that we have a function that strips the last characters from a string. And further suppose that when we strip characters, we usually want to strip only the last character in the string. We can do this using a function like the one below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">strip_ending &lt;- function(s, m = 1) {
    n &lt;- nchar(s)                 # get number of characters 
    new_s &lt;- substr(s, 1, n - m)  # cut `m` characters
    
    return(new_s)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can call this function to remove the last characters of a string. By default, it will remove the last 1 character, but we can changes this to be any number we want. This is illustrated below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">my_name &lt;- &quot;jones.&quot;

a &lt;- strip_ending(my_name)

b &lt;- strip_ending(my_name, m = 3)

print(a)
print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>Running the above code, we see that the first function call creates an object <code>a</code> that holds the string <code>&quot;jones&quot;</code>, and the string <code>b</code> that holds the string <code>&quot;jon&quot;</code>. And of course, we note that the two function calls are taking the same input string as their first argument (i.e., <code>my_name</code>); the only difference is that in the first case, we let the default argument determine the number of characters to strip off the end—in the second case, we specify it explicitly.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="5"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Note that in R (unlike in Python), indentation is not actually required for defining code blocks. The use of curly braces (i.e., <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>) is what R uses to denote code blocks. Nonetheless, indentation makes our code <em>vastly</em> more readable, and we will always use indentation in practice.</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#control-flow" id="control-flow">Control Flow</a></h1>
<p>In any software application or script it is often essential to be able to control the &quot;flow of execution&quot;. For example, suppose that a portion of our code should only be execute if some condition is met. Or in a different example, suppose that we want a function in our code to excute repeatedly—perhaps even hundreds, thousands, or millions of times. These are examples of problems we can solve using control flow statements in R.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-if-statement" id="the-if-statement">The <code>if</code> Statement</a></h2>
<p>One of the most commonly used mechanisms of controling flow of execution is with the use of <code>if</code> statements. The <code>if</code> statement, unsurprisingly, allows us to execute a piece of code <em>if</em> some conditiion is met. Consider the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">v &lt;- 17

if (v &gt; 8) {
    print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code above prints <code>&quot;Hello!&quot;</code>; but of course, if we set <code>v</code> to be equal to <code>8</code> or less, then nothing will be printed. Note also that we can (and usually do) have more complicated operations in our <code>if</code> blocks.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-else-statement" id="the-else-statement">The <code>else</code> Statement</a></h2>
<p>Much like the <code>if</code> statement, the <code>else</code> statement can be used to execute some piece of code based on conditions being met or not met. The example below extends our previous example. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">u &lt;- 27

if (u &gt; 100000) {
    print(&quot;u is a large number!&quot;)
} else {
    print(&quot;u is not that large...&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>As we see in the example above, the code in the <code>else</code> block is executed since <code>u</code> is set to be less than <code>100000</code>. Note that the <code>else</code> block must follow an <code>if</code> block. But note also that not every <code>if</code> block has an <code>else</code> block.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#sequential-ifelse-statements" id="sequential-ifelse-statements">Sequential <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> Statements</a></h3>
<p>A common pattern, and one that you may use yourself is to have a sequence of <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> statements. Consider the example below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">today &lt;- &quot;Friday&quot;

if (today == &quot;Monday&quot;) {
    print(&quot;Boo...&quot;)
} else if (today %in% c(&quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;)) {
    print(&quot;...&quot;)
} else if (today %in% c(&quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Saturday&quot;, &quot;Sunday&quot;)) {
    print(&quot;Yay!&quot;)
} else {
    print(&quot;Hmm... what day is this?&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code above has a few different possible paths of execution; in particular, there are 4 possible  paths that the code might take based on the content of the variable <code>today</code>. Note that the possible branches here are mutually exclusive; that is, only one of those four branches will execute on any given run of this code. </p>
<p>As an aside, the code block above also introduces the <code>%in%</code> operator, which checks for containment. Essentially, the expression <code>a %in% b</code> returns a boolean value when <code>a</code> is an element of <code>b</code>. For example <code>3 %in% 1:10</code> would return <code>TRUE</code> since <code>3</code> is in the range of <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#looping" id="looping">Looping</a></h2>
<p>In addition to controling our code's flow of execution with conditional branching, it is also hugely useful to be able to repeatedly carry out operations. This kind of repeated execution can be accomplished using a few &quot;looping&quot; statements. In particular, we will explore the <code>for</code> loop and the <code>while</code> loop. We will also discuss their respective strengths.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-for-loop" id="the-for-loop">The <code>for</code> Loop</a></h2>
<p>One of the most commonly used constructs in almost any programming language is the <code>for</code> loop. The <code>for</code> loop gives us a way to execute a give code block a specified number of times. For example, the code snippet below prints the integers from 1 to 5.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">for (i in 1:5) {
    print(i)
}
</code></pre>
<p>It is worth pointing out here that directly after the <code>for</code> statement, and in between the parentheses, is where we specify how many iterations the loop will execute. Specifically, when we say <code>(i in 1:5)</code>, what we are actually saying is that the code block will execute 5 times, with <code>i</code> taking a different value each time (i.e., <code>1</code> on the first iteration, <code>2</code> on the second, and so on).</p>
<p>Note that there is no requirement that we use the index variable (e.g., <code>i</code>) in the body of our loop. Also note that the index variable can be named arbitrarily, just like any other variable in R. Consider the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">for (soup in 1:6) {
    print(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, we call our index varaible <code>soup</code>; and note that we never actually use the variable in the loop's body. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-while-loop" id="the-while-loop">The <code>while</code> Loop</a></h2>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop is very similar to the <code>for</code> loop. The key difference is that the <code>while</code> loop can be used when we do not know ahead of time the number of iterations we want to use. A very common example is one in which we are doing some kind of approximation, and we want to keep going until some value in the computation surpasses some threshold. Consider the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">a &lt;- 100

while (a &gt; 1) {
    print(a)
    a &lt;- a/2
}
</code></pre>
<p>As we see in the above snippet, the <code>while</code> loop is similar to the <code>for</code> loop in the sense that there is an expression in parentheses after the <code>while</code> keyword. It is this expression that controls how many iterations our loop will execute. In the example above, the loop executes until the variable <code>a</code> has a value less than <code>1</code>. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#chosing-between-for-and-while-loops" id="chosing-between-for-and-while-loops">Chosing Between <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> Loops</a></h2>
<p>In general, we can accomplish almost every kind of looping task with either a <code>for</code> loop or a <code>while</code>. When choosing which one to use, the general rule-of-thumb is to use a <code>for</code> loop when we know in advance the number of iterations we want to execute, and to use a <code>while</code> loop when we do not.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#early-exit-and-skipping-iterations" id="early-exit-and-skipping-iterations">Early Exit and Skipping Iterations</a></h2>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop and <code>while</code> loop give us a great deal of power and flexibility in terms of excuting repeated operations. Another very useful feature of both of these is the ability to exit the loop early and to skip iterations as needed. These two features are implemented using <code>break</code> and <code>next</code> constructs. Both of these statements allow us to control the loop's behavior from within the actual loop itself. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#using-break-to-exit-early" id="using-break-to-exit-early">Using <code>break</code> to Exit Early</a></h3>
<p>Often, we are in the position of generally knowing the nuber of iterations we want to execute, but also want to be able to exit our loop if something occurs. This is the usecase for the <code>break</code> statement. By using <code>break</code>, we are able to prematurely exit a loop prior to its natural stopping point. Consider the example below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">for (i in 1:100) {
    print(i)
    if (i &gt; 5) {
        print(&quot;oh, no!!&quot;)
        break
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As we see above, the code is meant to execute 100 iterations, but we exit the loop after only 6 iterations. This is a somewhat contrived example, since we could have just as easily used a <code>while</code> loop to accomplish this, but the point is clear. Also note that this is the first time we have seen an <code>if</code> statement embeddeded in a loop. This is actually a very common practice. In fact, you will also frequently see loops embedded in other loops and various combinations of <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> statements in different combinations of <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#using-next-to-skip-an-iteration" id="using-next-to-skip-an-iteration">Using <code>next</code> to Skip an Iteration</a></h3>
<p>Somewhat like <code>break</code>, we can use the <code>next</code> statement to control the behavior of a loop from within the loop. Consider the example below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-r">for (i in 1:10) {
    if (i %% 2 == 0) {
        next
    }
    print(i)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example we use the <code>next</code> statement to skip all the iterations where <code>i</code> is an even number (recall that the modulo operator gives us the remainder of integer division).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-dataframe-and-tidy-data" id="the-dataframe-and-tidy-data">The <code>data.frame</code> and Tidy Data</a></h1>
<p>In this lesson we will cover the basics of data in R and will do so from a somewhat opinionated viewpoint of &quot;Tidy Data&quot;.  There are other paradigms and other ways to work with data in R, but focusing on Tidy Data concepts and tools (a.k.a., The Tidyverse) gets people to a productive place the quickest.  For more on data analysis using the Tidyverse, the best resource I know of is <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz">R for Data Science</a>.  The approaches we will cover are very much inspired by this book.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-dataframe" id="the-dataframe">The <code>data.frame</code></a></h2>
<p>Simply put, a data structure is a way for programming languages to handle storing information.  Like most languages, R has several structures (vectors, matrix, lists, etc.).  But R was originally built for data analysis, so the <code>data.frame</code>, a spreadsheet like structure with rows and columns, is the most widely used.  In addition, the <code>data.frame</code> is the basis for many modern R pacakges (e.g. the tidyverse) and getting used to it will allow you to quickly build your R skills.</p>
<p>Best way to learn what a data frame is is to look at one.  Let's now build a simple data frame from scratch with the <code>data.frame()</code> function.  This is mostly a teaching excercise as we will use the function very little in the excercises to come.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># Our first data frame

my_df &lt;- data.frame(names = c(&quot;jones&quot;,&quot;lee&quot;,&quot;smith&quot;,&quot;yang&quot;), 
                    age = c(45, 27, 38,51), 
                    knows_r = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE,FALSE), 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
my_df
</code></pre>
<p>That created a data frame with 3 columns (names, age, knows_r) and four rows.  For each row we have some information on the name of an individual (stored as a character/string), their age (stored as a numeric value), and a column indicating if they know R or not (stored as a boolean/logical).</p>
<p>If you have worked with data before in a spreadsheet or from a table in a database, this rectangular structure should look somewhat familiar.   One way (there are many!) we can access the different parts of the data frame is like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># Use the dollar sign to get a column
my_df$age
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-r"># Grab a row with indexing
my_df[2,]
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>built a data frame from scratch</li>
<li>seen rows and columns</li>
<li>heard about &quot;rectangular&quot; structure</li>
<li>seen how to get a row and a column</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of all this was to introduce the concept of the data frame.  Moving forward we will use other tools to read in data, but the end result will be the same: a data frame with rows (i.e. observations) and columns (i.e. variables).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#reading-in-data" id="reading-in-data">Reading in data</a></h2>
<p>Completely creating a data frame from scratch is useful (especially when you start writing your own functions), but more often than not data is stored in an external file that you need to read into R.  These may be delimited text files, spreadsheets, relational databases, SAS files ...  You get the idea.  Instead of treating this subject exhaustively, we will focus just on a single file type, the <code>.csv</code> file, that is very commonly encountered and (usually) easy to create from other file types.  For this, we will use the Tidyverse way to do this and use  <code>read_csv()</code> from the <code>readr</code> pacakge.</p>
<p>The <code>read_csv()</code> function is a re-imagined version of the base R fucntion, <code>read.csv()</code>.  This command assumes a header row with column names and that the delimiter is a comma. The expected no data value is NA and by default, strings are NOT converted to factors.  This is a big benefit to using <code>read_csv()</code> as opposed to <code>read.csv()</code>.  Additionally, <code>read_csv()</code> has some performance enhancements that make it preferrable when working with larger data sets.  In my limited experience it is about 45% faster than the base R options.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#other-interesting-types" id="other-interesting-types">Other Interesting Types</a></h1>
<p>R has a number of other interesting types in the base language. The types discussed below are interesting in a number of ways. Of particular interest is the manner in which they hint at the early use cases and motivations for developing the R langauge; that is, working with tabular data, that is continuous or categorical, and which sometimes contain missing values. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-na-type" id="the-na-type">The <code>NA</code> Type</a></h1>
<p>One exceedingly common feature of working with real data sets is that they contain missing values. That is, for whatever reason, some entry was omitted for a given record. As an example, suppose a patient did not enter their age on the patient intake form. This would be a missing value that we then have to handle. </p>
<p>Missing data is so ubiquitous in real data sets that R has a built-in type for representing missing values. This is the <code>NA</code> type. The <code>NA</code> type is special in the sense that it &quot;propogates&quot; over computations. Note the example below, where we try to take the summation of the elements in the <code>vals</code> vector. </p>
