<p>The aim of this module is to be a fully asynchronous introduction to programming and data science for students in Brown's MPA program. The module is divided in to 4 lessons, with each lesson being mostly independent of one another<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This module is a highly applied introduction to data science and programming for students who do not yet have experience in these areas. The overall objective for this module is to empower students to use a technical computing language to acquire, clean, and analyze data in order to answer policy-based research questions.</p>
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> The exception here is for the <code>Foundations</code> lesson. As the name implies, this is an essential lesson for understanding other lessons.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#module-format" id="module-format">Module Format</a></h1>
<p>The module attempts to be a &quot;from-the-ground-up&quot; approach to reading and writing code in a technical computing language. We do not make any assumptions about students' prior exposure to any programming language. The examples will primarily be done using the R programming language<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> For those with existing programming language preferences, we will happily answer question if you choose to complete the exercises in R, Python, or Julia. </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h1>
<h1><a class="header" href="#unix-shell" id="unix-shell">Unix Shell</a></h1>
<p>A huge proportion of scientific computing, software engineering, and data science is done using decendants of the Unix operating system. Both Linux and macOS are in the Unix family tree, and as such, they offer a &quot;shell&quot; for talking to the operating system. A shell is essentially a program to launch other programs. </p>
<p>In practice, the shell is frequently used for issuing commands that manipulate files and folders on the computer, but the shell is a phoenomenally powerful mechanism for performing a huge number of tasks. It is generally accepted that a person who is considered a technologist of any kind will be comfortable working from the operating system (OS) shell.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#shell-basics" id="shell-basics">Shell Basics</a></h2>
<p>On Linux and macOS, you can access the shell by opening the <code>Terminal</code> application. Once you've opened the terminal, you will see a default command prompt that looks somewhat like the one below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">work_macbook@:~ paul$
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>work_macbook</code> would actually be the name of your machine, and <code>paul</code> would be your username. Your prompt will obviously look a bit different. The key feature is that the prompt will typically end with the <code>$</code> character. This is where you issue commands to the operating system.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#exploring-filesystem" id="exploring-filesystem">Exploring Filesystem</a></h2>
<p>The filesystem you see when you interact with the prompt is the same as you would see using an application like <code>Finder</code> (on macOS). That is, you can see the files and folders as you normally would using the graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
<p>One of the most common commands used for exploring the file system is <code>ls</code>. This issues a command to the operating system to &quot;list&quot; the files in the currect directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ls
</code></pre>

</code></pre>
<p>The output of <code>ls</code> shows a list of the files and directories (i.e., folders) in our current location. Note that by default, our &quot;current location&quot; is probably the &quot;home&quot; directory of our user. We can determine our current directory with the <code>pwd</code> command, which is short for <strong>p</strong>rint <strong>w</strong>orking <strong>d</strong>irectory). See the example below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pwd
</code></pre>
<pre><code>/Users/paul
</code></pre>
<p>And in the example above <code>paul</code> would be replaced by your username. </p>
<p>Note that we can use <code>ls</code> to show more information or to display the information in slightly different way. This is done by passing optional arguments when calling <code>ls</code>. For example, it is very common to run <code>ls -l</code>, which produces output like you see below.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Adding the optional <code>-l</code> &quot;flag&quot; when calling the <code>ls</code> command gives us output that is much more verbose than our original <code>ls</code> command. We will explore in greater detail what each of these columns mean, but short explanation is that this gives us information about who owns the files or directories, what the permission settings are, the sizes, and when they were last changed. </p>
<p>Another very useful flag we can pass when calling <code>ls</code> is the <code>-a</code> option. This tells the operating system we would like to see a list of <em>all</em> files and directories in the current working directory—this includes those that are &quot;hidden&quot;. It is worth noting here that on Unix-like systems, hidden files and directories have the <code>.</code> symbol as the first character in their names. Thus, saving a file as <code>.find_me.txt</code> on a Unix-like system would cause it to be a hidden file. </p>
<p>We can also chain together flags when we call <code>ls</code>—or any other command. For example, running <code>ls -la</code> is very common, and it tells the operating system to list all the files, including the hidden ones, and to do so in the more verbose &quot;long&quot; format. </p>
<p>We can move around the filesystem using the <code>cd</code> command. This command lets us <strong>c</strong>hange the <strong>d</strong>irectory in which we are currently. For example if we are in our home directory (e.g., <code>/Users/paul</code>) and we want to change to the <code>Documents</code> directory, we would issue the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd Documents
</code></pre>
<p>And now if we issue the <code>pwd</code> command, we will see our new current working directory has changed to something similar to the example below.</p>
<pre><code>/Users/paul/Documents
</code></pre>
<p>We can return to our previous directory by typing the <code>cd ..</code>, which is the Unix shorthand for &quot;<em>go back up one level in the file hierarchy</em>&quot;. This leaves us back in the <code>/Users/paul</code> directory. Note that if we wanted to back up two levels, we would run <code>cd ../..</code>, which would leave us in the <code>/Users</code> directory. And of course, we could take that even further by running <code>cd ../../..</code> which would take us up three levels in the hierarchy in to the <code>/</code> directory, which is the top-level directory.</p>
<p>Another very useful shorthand is using the <code>cd</code> command by itself. The default behavior when simply running <code>cd</code> is for the operating system to return you to your &quot;home&quot; directory. The &quot;home&quot; directory is the base location in the filesystem where a user will have files and directories belonging to them; in my case <code>/Users/paul</code> is my home directory. The files and directories within are &quot;mine&quot;. It is also common to return to the home directory by running <code>cd ~</code> or sometimes <code>cd ~/</code>. All of these have the same effect of returning the user to their home directory.</p>
<p>Note that as we previously used the <code>cd</code> command to enter the <code>Documents</code> directory, we can also use <code>cd</code> to enter the sub-directories within <code>Documents</code> directory—that is, those directories that are themselves in the <code>Documents</code> directory. This is done using the same <code>/</code> notation that we used when moving up two levels in the filesystem hierarchy. That is, instead of running <code>cd ../..</code>, we would run <code>cd Documents/Courses</code>. Here <code>Courses</code> is the sub-directory within Documents.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-undeniable-beauty-of-tab-complete" id="the-undeniable-beauty-of-tab-complete">The Undeniable Beauty of <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>-Complete</a></h3>
<p>One of the wildly useful and lovely features of Unix-like shells is the ability to use the <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key to complete a command. For example, suppose we have directory named <code>my_very_important_cool_project</code>. And suppose further that we want to <code>cd</code> in to that directory. To accomplish this, we would obviously need to type <code>cd my_very_important_cool_project</code>. But suppose also that we are lazy and would prefer not to type out a 30-character directory name. This is the beauty of <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>-complete. We can simply start typing our command (e.g., <code>cd my_very</code>) and then press <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>, and the operating system will fill in the rest of the directory name. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#absolute-and-relative-paths" id="absolute-and-relative-paths">Absolute and Relative Paths</a></h3>
<p>It is worth noting at this point that the <code>cd</code> commands we have been running have thus far all been using the &quot;relative&quot; paths of directories. That is, the commands worked because or our position in the filesystem <em>relative</em> to the directory we wanted to access. For example, if we were back in the <code>/Users</code> directory, running <code>cd Documents</code> would return the error below. </p>
<pre><code>bash: cd: Documents: No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>What this error tells us is that <code>cd</code> returned an error because it could not find that file or directory. And this is because the <code>Documents</code> directory is in the home directory of the user <code>paul</code>. So if we want <code>cd Documents</code> to work as we expect, we need to run that from within the <code>/Users/paul</code> directory. </p>
<p>However, we could also acheive the desired result by passing the <code>cd</code> command the <em>absolute path</em> of the directory. That is, we could run <code>cd /Users/paul/Documents</code>, and this would work exactly as intended. And furthermore, this would work as intended <em>regardless of where we are in the filesystem</em>. We could be anywhere, and if we run <code>cd /Users/paul/Documents</code>, it would always take us to the <code>Documents</code> directory in our home directory.</p>
<p>Note that the above applies for more than just the <code>cd</code> command; the concept of relative and absolute paths is also true for <code>ls</code> and any other command. For example we could be anywhere on the filesystem, and if we run <code>ls /Users/paul/Documents</code>, it will show a list of the files and directories in our <code>Documents</code> directory.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#moving-and-renaming-files" id="moving-and-renaming-files">Moving and Renaming Files</a></h2>
<p>We can use the <code>mv</code> command both for moving and for renaming files and directories. Lets start by creating a file named <code>potato.txt</code>. We can use the <code>touch</code> command to create this file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">touch potato.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We can then use <code>mv</code> to rename the file to be <code>fries.txt</code> using the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mv potato.txt fries.txt
</code></pre>
<p>And now we can also use <code>mv</code> to move the file to a completely different location.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mv fries.txt /tmp
</code></pre>
<p>The command above takes the <code>fries.txt</code> file and moves it to the <code>/tmp</code> directory.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#creating-directories" id="creating-directories">Creating Directories</a></h2>
<p>We have already seen that <code>ls</code> can be used to list the contents of the current working directory. And we have seen that <code>pwd</code> will print the full path of our current working directory. Now we examine the command <code>mkdir</code>. As you might have guessed from the name, this command is used to <strong>m</strong>ake <strong>d</strong>irectories. For example, suppose we return to our <code>Documents</code> directory using the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/Documents
</code></pre>
<p>We can then create the directory <code>/Users/paul/Documents/mpa2065</code> by running the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir mpa2065
</code></pre>
<p>We can now treat this directory like any other (i.e., create files or directories inside it). </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#copying-files-and-directories" id="copying-files-and-directories">Copying Files (and Directories)</a></h2>
<p>We can use the <code>cp</code> command to create copies of files and directories. When creating a copy of a file, we simply pass two arguments to <code>cp</code>: the name of the &quot;source&quot; file, and the path or name of the copy being made. For example, let's create a file called <code>foo.txt</code> in our <code>Documents</code> directory. We can do this with the commands below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/Documents

touch foo.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose now that we want to create a copy of <code>foo.txt</code> and call it <code>foo2.txt</code>. We can do this by running the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cp foo.txt foo2.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The first argument to <code>cp</code> is our source file, and the second is what we want to call the output. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#removing-files-and-directories" id="removing-files-and-directories">Removing Files and Directories</a></h2>
<p>The <code>rm</code> command is used to remove (i.e., permanently delete) files and directories. The exact syntax for deleting a file is simply <code>rm &lt;filename&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> is the name of the file. So for example, the command below would delete the <code>foo.txt</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rm foo.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We can also use <code>rm</code> for deleting directories. This is done by passing the <code>-r</code> flag when calling <code>rm</code>. For example, the commands below creates and then subsequently deletes the directory <code>baz</code>. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir baz

rm -r baz
</code></pre>
<h1><a class="header" href="#git-basics" id="git-basics">Git Basics</a></h1>
<p>The most popular version control system for code is Git. In this section we will discuss the basic features of a version control system as well as why version control systems are important. We will also go through the basics of Git, in particular, as well as its relative advantages over other version control systems that came before. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-version-control" id="why-version-control">Why Version Control?</a></h2>
<p>Version control systems exist to solve a number of related problems. First, we would like snapshots of our code that allow us to implement new features and components that map to a particular version tag (e.g., &quot;<em>Encrypted sharding is available as of version 1.2.0</em>&quot;). Second, we would like to confidentally make changes to our code while also preserving the ability to &quot;roll back&quot; the code to a known-good state. Being able to experiment with so-called breaking changes before pushing them in to a more production-level release is an essential component of writing code. Third, we would like to be able to code collaboratively such that one person can be working on feature <code>abc</code> and another person working on feature <code>xyz</code> in the same code base. This last problem (i.e., having <em>distributed</em> version control) is solved particular well by Git. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#distributed-version-control" id="distributed-version-control">Distributed Version Control</a></h3>
<p>The predecessors of Git were less effective in solving the problem of distributed version control. And since modern code bases are often in the hundreds-of-thousands (or even millions) of lines of code, it would be impossible for a single developer to do all the maintence. Thus, we need large teams to work collaboratively, while also preserving the ability to make changes without &quot;clobbering&quot; each others' work.</p>
<p>You may not have considered this yet, but if you have ever used Google Docs, or any similar product, then you have already used a distributed version control system. Google Docs can be shared and simultaneously editted by an arbitrarilly large number of authors. Moreover, Google also provides some functionality for reversing changes and re-instantiating prior versions of the document. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-git-repository" id="what-is-a-git-repository">What is a Git Repository?</a></h2>
<p>At a high-level, a Git repository—often called a &quot;repo&quot;—is a directory which we have flagged to be version controlled by Git. Essentially, we have told Git &quot;<em>Please track changes to files in this directory</em>&quot;. </p>
<p>A very typical Git workflow is to have a repository per project or per software application. Files are then &quot;checked in&quot; to version control when we tell Git that we want the files tracked. We then take snapshots—known as &quot;commits&quot; in Git parlance—when we make significant or important changes. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#local-vs-remote-repositories" id="local-vs-remote-repositories">Local vs. Remote Repositories</a></h3>
<p>A key distinction should be made before we move on. That distinction is between the &quot;local&quot; and &quot;remote&quot; repository. As the name implies, a local repository exists on you &quot;local machine&quot; (e.g., your laptop or desktop). A remote repository, on the other hand, exists in some location other than your local machine; thus, it is remote in the sense that it is elsewhere. Remote repositories are typically housed on purpose-built platforms for code sharing and version control. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#github-and-remote-repos" id="github-and-remote-repos">Github and Remote Repos</a></h3>
<p>Github is one of the most popular code sharing and versioning platforms; other similar platforms currently include Gitlab and Bitbucket. All three of these platforms share a great deal of the same functionality. In particular, they give us a place to store, distribute, and backup our code. These platforms are typically what we use to house our &quot;remote repos&quot; mentioned above. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#basic-git-workflow" id="basic-git-workflow">Basic Git Workflow</a></h2>
<p>In this section we walk through a standard Git workflow of creating a repository, then committing code to the repository, making some changes, and then committing the changes. We must first ensure that Git is actually installed on our machine; to confirm this, we can simply open the shell and run <code>git --version</code>. This should return some output like we see below.</p>
<pre><code>git version 2.20.1
</code></pre>
<p>If we instead observe an error message suggesting <code>command not found</code>, then we must install Git through the standard methods (e.g., <code>brew install git</code> on macOS, <code>apt-get install git</code> on Debian and Ubuntu, <code>yum install git</code> on CentOS and Red Hat, etc.).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#creating-a-git-repo" id="creating-a-git-repo">Creating a Git Repo</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, a Git repository is a directory that we have asked Git to monitor. Thus, if we are starting a new project, we would often begin by creating the diretory itself. Recall that on Unix-like systems we can create directories using the <code>mkdir</code> command. </p>
<p>Suppose we like the first sentences of novels, and suppose that we are creating a repository to store all our favorite first lines. Let us create a directory called <code>first_lines</code>. We do this by issuing the command below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir ~/first_lines
</code></pre>
<p>Note that by specifying <code>~/first_lines</code>, we will be creating the directory in our &quot;home&quot; directory, (i.e., in my case, <code>/Users/paul</code>). So I should now have a directory at <code>/Users/paul/first_lines</code>. To confirm this, we can run the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ls ~/
</code></pre>
<p>And we should see the <code>first_lines</code> directory in the output of that command.</p>
<p>Now, in order to actually initialize this directory as a git repo, we will first <code>cd</code> in to the directory with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/first_lines
</code></pre>
<p>And once we are inside the <code>first_lines</code> directory, we can then initialize the directory as a git repository with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git init
</code></pre>
<p>This has the effect of telling <code>git</code> that we want the changes to the contents of this directory to be tracked. Just to confirm, we can then run this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git status
</code></pre>
<p>and we should see some output like this:</p>
<pre><code>On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>
<p>As this output suggests, we are on the <code>master</code> branch in this repository, and we have not yet made any commits.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#making-our-first-commit" id="making-our-first-commit">Making our First Commit</a></h3>
<p>Let's open a plaintext editor (e.g., Nano, Vim, Emacs, Sublime) and create a file called <code>lines.txt</code> and populate with our first entry, which is the first line of <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</p>
<pre><code>There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.
</code></pre>
<p>Let's save and exit from our text editor. And now we will again run <code>git status</code>. This time we get some more interesting output.</p>
<pre><code>On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)

	lines.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>
<p>As we see above, git has now noticed that we have a file that exists in this repo, but it is not yet tracked. And Git even gives us the hint that our next step to add the file to be track is to use the <code>git add</code> command, which we do with the command below. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git add lines.txt
</code></pre>
<p>And now when we run <code>git status</code> again, we see something like the output below.</p>
<pre><code>On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)

	new file:   lines.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Git has noticed that we have added a file to the staging area, but no commits have been made yet. We can finally make the commit with the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git commit -m &quot;added line from jane eyre&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>git commit</code> command tells Git to add the file(s) from the staging area to the repository, and we pass it a commit message using the <code>-m</code> optional flag followed by the message in quotes. Git will then provide some output like we see below to confirm that the commit has been successful.</p>
<pre><code>[master (root-commit) aa601ee] added line from jane eyre
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 lines.txt
</code></pre>
<p>We can also get more information about the commit by using the <code>git log</code> command, which generates output much like what we see below.</p>
<pre><code>commit aa601eed8c173947c345fa1d213a919bdf2c11cd (HEAD -&gt; master)
Author: paul &lt;paul@gmail.com&gt;
Date:   Wed Sep 10 18:43:51 2019 -0400

    added line from jane eyre
</code></pre>
<p>A couple of points ought to be noted here. First, git commits all have unique identifiers that are a 40-character string of alphanumberics. This is how we can uniquely identify a commit. Also note that the commit log stores all the information regarding the commit's author and timestamp. And of course, the commit log has the commit message associated with the commit.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-commit" id="adding-a-new-commit">Adding a New Commit</a></h3>
<p>Suppse we want to add another line to our <code>lines.txt</code> file. In this case, let's add the first line of <em>Anna Karenina</em> using our text editor.</p>
<pre><code>Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's save those changes and close our text editor. And if we run <code>git status</code> again, we see something like the output below. </p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   lines.txt

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, Git has noticed that we have made changes to the <code>lines.txt</code> file. In order to capture these changes in the repo, we need to use <code>git add lines.txt</code> once again. After that, we can move those changes from the staging area to the actual repository with the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git commit -m &quot;added anna karenina&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now in case we are curious we can explore the differences between Git commits using the <code>git diff</code> command. In particular, we use <code>git diff</code> in combination with the commit ID (or the first few characters of it), and the file name. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git diff aa601 lines.txt
</code></pre>
<p>As we see in the command above, we tell Git to show us the differences between in the <code>lines.txt</code> file in the current state and that of the commit whose commit ID starts with <code>aa601</code>.</p>
<p>And we would then see some output like this:</p>
<pre><code>diff --git a/lines.txt b/lines.txt

--- a/lines.txt
+++ b/lines.txt

<h2><a class="header" href="#remote-repositories" id="remote-repositories">Remote Repositories</a></h2>
<p>The concept of a &quot;remote repository&quot; highlights one of Git's greatest strength. As mentioned above, a local repository refers to the Git repository on your &quot;local&quot; machine (but note that &quot;local machine&quot; might actually be the server you are using). The &quot;remote repository&quot; is a repository that lives elsewhere—typically on a hosting platform such as Github or one of their counterparts (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). </p>
<p>Remote repos enable the distributed aspect of version control with Git. For example, we might have two software engineers, Jones and Lee, each working on the same code base. Lee might be adding feature <code>xyz</code> and Jones might be adding feature <code>abc</code>. They can both implement the features on their local machines, and in many cases, neither needs to be involved in the other's development. Then, once they are finished, they can push their respective changes to the remote repository where they can be integrated. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#adding-a-remote-repository" id="adding-a-remote-repository">Adding a Remote Repository</a></h3>
<p>For repositories that we have started &quot;from scratch&quot; on our local machines, we can add a remote repo whenever we would like. This has a couple of steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create remote repo</li>
<li>Grab URL of the remote repo</li>
<li>Add remote to local git</li>
</ol>
<p>The above steps are carried out differently depending on the hosting platform you choose, but they should be fairly transparent once you have done it once or twice. On GitHub, we simply click on the <code>+</code> icon in the top-right corner, and then select <code>New repository</code>. </p>
<p>Once we have created the remote in GitHub (or on another hosting platform), we can simply return to our local repo and run this</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git remote add orgin &lt;URL&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;URL&gt;</code> is replaced by the URL for the newly created remote repo. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repo" id="pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repo">Pushing Commits to a Remote Repo</a></h3>
<p>Once we have added our remote repo, and we have made some commits, we are ready to push these to the remote repo. This is simply done using <code>git push</code> command followed by the name of the remote, which we specified above as <code>origin</code> as well as the name of the branch. In the example below, we are pushing to the <code>master</code> branch. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git push origin master
