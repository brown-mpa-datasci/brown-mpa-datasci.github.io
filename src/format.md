# Module Format

The module attempts to be a "from-the-ground-up" approach to reading and writing code in a technical computing language. We do not make any assumptions about students' prior exposure to any programming language. The examples will primarily be done using the R programming language[^1].

This website contains the notes for the various topics, as well as the videos lessons for the related topics. The videos appear as links at the end of a given section; the videos lessons are also all linked in the Appendix.

[^1] For those with existing programming language preferences, we will happily answer question if you choose to complete the exercises in R, Python, or Julia.
