# Module Format

The module attempts to be a "from-the-ground-up" approach to reading and writing code in a technical computing language. We do not make any assumptions about students' prior exposure to any programming language. The examples will primarily be done using the R programming language[^1].





[^1] For those with existing programming language preferences, we will happily answer question if you choose to complete the exercises in R, Python, or Julia.
