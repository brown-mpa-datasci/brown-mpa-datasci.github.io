The lessons in this section represent what we believe to be some of the core elements for students interested in data science and technical computing. In addition to introducing the basic functionality of a technical computing language (i.e., R, in this particular case), we also outline some of the basics of working with a Unix-like operating system's command line interface, as well as the basic elements of using the Git version control system.
