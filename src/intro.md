# Welcome!!!

The aim of this module is to be a fully asynchronous introduction to programming and data science for students in Brown's MPA program. The module is divided in to 4 lessons, with each lesson being mostly independent of one another[^1].


This module is a highly applied introduction to data science and programming for students who do not yet have experience in these areas. The overall objective for this module is to empower students to use a technical computing language to acquire, clean, and analyze data in order to answer policy-based research questions.














[^1] The exception here is for the `Foundations` lesson. As the name implies, this is an essential lesson for understanding other lessons.
