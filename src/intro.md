# Welcome!!!

The aim of this module is to be a fully asynchronous introduction to programming and data science for students in Brown's MPA program. Most of the content for this module was pulled from different iteration of the MPA 2065 course[^1]. The module is divided in to 4 sub-modules, with each lesson being mostly independent of one another[^2].

This module is a highly applied introduction to data science and programming for students who do not yet have experience in these areas. The overall objective for this module is to empower students to use a technical computing language to acquire, clean, and analyze data in order to answer policy-based research questions.

## Prerequisites
This module does not assume any previous exposure to programming. We do assume some exposure to probability and statistics. In particular, we presume students have completed one semester of introductory statistics.

[^1] So, if you have already take this course, then the material (and the video lessons) will mostly be review.

[^2] The exception here is for the `Foundations` lesson. As the name implies, this is an essential lesson for understanding other sub-modules.
