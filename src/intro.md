# Welcome!!!

The aim of this module is to be a fully asynchronous introduction to programming and data science for MPA students. The module is divided in to 4 lessons, with each lesson being mostly independent of one another[^1].


This module is a highly applied introduction to data science and programming for students who do not yet have experience in these areas. The overall objective for this module is to empower students to use a technical computing language to acquire, clean, and analyze data in order to answer policy-based research questions.

## Module Format

The module attempts to be a "from-the-ground-up" approach to reading and writing code in a technical computing language. We do not make any assumptions about students' prior exposure to any programming language. The examples will primarily be done using the R programming language[^2].











[^1] The exception here is for the `Foundations` lesson. As the name implies, this is an essential lesson for understanding other lessons.

[^2] For those with existing programming language preferences, we will happily answer question if you choose to complete the exercises in R, Python, or Julia.
