# Introduction

The aim of this module is to be a fully asynchronous introduction to programming and data science for MPA students. The module is divided in to 4 lessons, with each lesson being mostly independent of one another[^1].


[^1] The exception here is for the `Foundations` lesson. As the name implies, this is an essential lesson for understanding other lessons.
