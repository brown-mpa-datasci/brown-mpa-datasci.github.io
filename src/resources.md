# Module Resources

The module utilize a combination of tools for asynchronous learning. In particular, we will use this website as the platform for sharing notes and video lessons. We will also use the JupyterHub[^1] [^2] computing environment for completing exercises and following along with the code. 

Additionally, all lessons' slides and code for this module are available on GitHub[^3].

Finally, students can use Slack to communicate with each other with questions.[^4]
